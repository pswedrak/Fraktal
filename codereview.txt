The reviewed program implements a ‘Tic-tac-toe’ game. While playing the game we did not notice any errors and the program worked properly 
but the code has not been tested thoroughly - developers provided only few tests. 

When it comes to the code we had to read very long functions consisting of many nested ‘if’ instructions and ‘where’ clauses,
we think that developers should have tried to simplify it. 

One function has a mistake in 'else if' statements - the same conditions are checked two times and give two different results, see 
(else if(seeGameStatus board3 == CrossWon && f1==Circle)).

Provided comments are insufficient, some parts of code are not commented at all, which makes a code a little unclear.

Giving information to the user is not consistent, because sometimes English is used, sometimes Polish. (The output “Klopsik” in a module TicTacToeGame)

If this project is still being developed, it would be a nice idea to add a possibility of playing with another person.

The great advantage of the code is that developers used possibilities that functional languages like Haskell give
- for example Maybe used while describing boards. It seems that they put a lot of effort in making this program.
